# Profile
I work as an Insurance Pricing Analyst and am currently doing a degree level apprenticeship in Data Science. I have worked in the Insurance industry for 25 years across multiple roles. For the last 14 years those roles have been in Analytical departments covering Personal Line Insurance and Application Fraud.

# Evolution of Analytical tools

When I first started in Analytical roles the Data I would work with was supplied by the centralised Data team, my team and I would use Excel to create basic charts and tables to demonstrate where pricing changes could be best placed. Shortly after I started we began to use the WTW software, Radar. This allowed us to use integrated rating tables to view prices for a batch of risks then apply changes and compare outputs.

Our need for data becamce more and the routinely updated tables from the central data team weren't going to be enough for all we wanted to see. At this point SAS started to be used to create our own tables and transform current tables to allow us to better analyse the data our organisation held.

After 4 years of this work I moved to Fraud, I was the first analyst in the application Fraud team and, as such, had to create all new reports from scratch.
